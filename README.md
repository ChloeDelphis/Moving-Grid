## My process

I got inspired to make this beautiful layout by an article on moving layout found on [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2020/06/10/how-to-create-a-motion-hover-effect-for-a-background-image-grid/).  
M goal was to give the effect of an infinite photo gallery.  
Although the article recommended to use GSAP, I challenged myself to make everything in Javascript Vanilla.
